## OVERVIEW
Walmart is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. Walmart have few physical stores in Myanmar, 
but some of its products are available in the country through local merchants who import them from other countries. Walmart products are mainly sold in City Mart, 
a leading supermarket chain in Myanmar that operates in 20 cities and towns. Walmart’s presence in Myanmar is limited by several factors, such as the political and economic situation, 
the lack of infrastructure, the competition from other retailers, and the consumer preferences. Walmart has not expressed any plans to dominate the Myanmar market, 
but it may consider doing so in the future if the conditions improve and the demand increases. Walmart operates in 20 other countries, including China, India, Japan, and Thailand.
